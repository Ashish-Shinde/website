### Portable Braille Reader
{{< youtube  B3hEWhktRMw >}}
\\
A portable, low-cost braille reader has adjustable reading speeds and the ability to go back in the text whenever required. A multistate button is used to start, pasue or restart the reading. A user can send any text file to the braille reader by using the Bluetooth on his cell phone. The device follows the Grade-I braille standard by making sure that all the identifier characters are correctly encoded. We also designed a debugger which was used to verify the functioning of the device. A PIC32 is interfaced with a Bluetooth and a putty debugger terminal using UART protocol.
